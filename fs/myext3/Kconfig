config MYEXT3_FS
	tristate "MyExt3 journalling file system support"
	default m
	help
	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called myext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of myext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the myext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of myext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on myext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create myext3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called myext3.

config MYEXT3_DEFAULTS_TO_ORDERED
	bool "Default to 'data=ordered' in myext3"
	depends on MYEXT3_FS
	default y
	help
	  The journal mode options for myext3 have different tradeoffs
	  between when data is guaranteed to be on disk and
	  performance.	The use of "data=writeback" can cause
	  unwritten data to appear in files after an system crash or
	  power failure, which can be a security issue.	 However,
	  "data=ordered" mode can also result in major performance
	  problems, including seconds-long delays before an fsync()
	  call returns.	 For details, see:

	  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/MyExt3_data_mode_tradeoffs

	  If you have been historically happy with myext3's performance,
	  data=ordered mode will be a safe choice and you should
	  answer 'y' here.  If you understand the reliability and data
	  privacy issues of data=writeback and are willing to make
	  that trade off, answer 'n'.

config MYEXT3_FS_XATTR
	bool "MyExt3 extended attributes"
	depends on MYEXT3_FS
	default y
	help
	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit
	  <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  If unsure, say N.

	  You need this for POSIX ACL support on myext3.

config MYEXT3_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "MyExt3 POSIX Access Control Lists"
	depends on MYEXT3_FS_XATTR
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	help
	  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the Posix ACLs for
	  Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N

config MYEXT3_FS_SECURITY
	bool "MyExt3 Security Labels"
	depends on MYEXT3_FS_XATTR
	help
	  Security labels support alternative access control models
	  implemented by security modules like SELinux.  This option
	  enables an extended attribute handler for file security
	  labels in the myext3 filesystem.

	  If you are not using a security module that requires using
	  extended attributes for file security labels, say N.
